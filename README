All MayLab-related scripts for general lab use should be kept here. This GitHub repository is maintained under the
"MayLab-UConn" GitHub organization name. To change or contribute, get your GitHub username added as a user to the GitHub
page. Current admins are Kevin and Eric.

The files in this repository can be accessed on the cluster at /shared/maylab/scripts, but if that'll be a read-only
repository, so to contribute you need to clone the repo on your own machine or partition in the cluster, then make the
modifications locally and push them.
